=head1 NAME

cfdivisions - A CFEngine3 module for organizing promises in a modular and goal intention based structure.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

cfdivisions [--inputs_path inputspath] [--library library] [] [--library_subdir dir] [--verbose]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<cfdivisions> is a CFEngine3 module for handling CFEngine modules called L<CFDivisions>. 
It ensures the generation of 

=over

=item * a consistent promisefile load sequence (C<body common control> / C<inputs>) and 

=item * a consistent bundlesequence (C<body common control> / C<bundlesequence>) over all sequenceable bundles inside a division library.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item --divisionfilter=<division1>,<division2>,...

A positive filter that defines names the only divisions to proces. Divisions that the filtered division are dependend on are implicit also processed.

=item --ignore_bundles=<bundle1>,<bundle2>,...

Names of bundles that are ignored in the generated bundlesequence.

=item --inputs_path=<path>

Alternative path to the CFEngines inputs-folder

=item --library=<name>

Name of the library. If no library is defined the default is 'division'.

=item --library_subdir=<subdirectory name>

Alternative directory name of the placement of divisions within the cfengines inputs-folder.
The library name is used as a default.

=item --namespace=<namespace>

The namespace for the whole libraries artifacts.
The library name is used as a default.

=item --verbose

Show more info when generating artefacts. Verbose out will be written at CFengine comments.
